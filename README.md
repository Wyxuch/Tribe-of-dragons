### WORK IN PROGRESS

This is my first "kind of incremental" web game made using React and Redux 

Basic goals of the game are: breedeing your strongest dragons, sending them hunting for treasures (cause dragons loves shiny things), upgraiding lair and gaining new territories.



### Features:
<ul>
<li><b>Procedurally generated dragons
  including:
  Name,
 Stats,
 Look!</b></li>
  <li>Lair with tons of upgrades</li>
  <li>Hunting for resources to upgrade your dragons lair</li>
  <li>War map with territories to be conquered</li>
  <li>Great fun for free (there will be no currency to buy or "Watch commercial for x2 gold for 10 minutes")</li>
</ul>


Finishing game can take some time cause it's solo project and making graphics takes time :/


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## A little sneak peak of how it looks right now.
